# DwarfsWordGame
Five Dwarfs play palindrome word game using their names. 

## Synopsis

Five Dwarves ( Gimli Fili Ilif Ilmig and Mark) met at the Prancing Pony and played a word game to determine which combinations of their names resulted in a palindrome. This program prints out all of those combinations.

There are two assumptions:
1. Each name can only be used once in each combination.
2. They are playing case insenstive game.
